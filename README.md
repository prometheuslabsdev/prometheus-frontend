## Project Structure

### PWA

To enhance offline capabilities and provide a better user experience, this app is structured as a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (PWA) using [@vite-pwa/plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/). The PWA setup ensures that essential assets are cached and available even when the user is offline, improving reliability and performance.

Some helpful commands include:

- `pnpm run generate-pwa-assets`: This command uses [@vite-pwa/assets-generator](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/assets-generator/) to automatically generate and optimize icons, splash screens, and other assets necessary for PWA functionality across various devices and screen sizes.
